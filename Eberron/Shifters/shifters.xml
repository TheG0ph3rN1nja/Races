      <p class="flavor">Geth's ancient heritage rose up from deep within him, spreading out from the core of his being. Some shifters manifested terrible claws, massive fangs, astounding speed, or heightened senses. Geth's gift from his lycanthrope ancestors was sheer toughness. Strength seeped into his bones and flooded his flesh. His skin hardened, and his hair became coarse like an animal's tough hide. A sense of invincibility spread through him. For the moment, at least, he felt unstoppable&#33;</p>

      <p class="flavor">Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe that they are descendants, of humans and lycanthropes. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect. While they can't fully change shape,they can temporarily enhance their animalistic-a state the call shifting. Whatever their origins, shifters have involved into a unique race. A shifter walks on the knife's edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path to civilization&#63;</p>

      <h4>THE BEAST WITHIN</h4>
      <p>Early in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within&#58; a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some Shifters believe that these spirits are independent entities, and they might speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges over time as the shifter's personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by the shifters personality&#58; a feline shifter might be cool and distant, driven by predatory, while a shifter with a lupine spirit is drawn to find and protect a pack. While a shifter fully embraces thsi beast within, they physically transform for a short time.</p>
      <p class="indent">This beast within is reflected by the shifter's subrace. The following subraces are especially common&#58;</p>
      <p><b>Beasthide</b> often signifies the bear or boar&#58; stoic, stubborn and thick-skinned.</p>
      <p><b>Longtooth</b> shifters typically have lupine traits and are attracted to pack life.</p>
      <p><b>Swiftstride</b> are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.</p>
      <p><b>Wildhunt</b> shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.</p>
      <p class="indent">While the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it also has a spiritual and psychological effect. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, they'll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character.</p>

      <h4>SIMILAR AND DIVERSE</h4>
      <p>Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are more naturally lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a beastial cast, with large eyes, flat noses, and pointed ears&#59; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth.They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies.</p>
      <p class="indent">The traits of the beast within affect a shifter's appearance as well. A swiftstride shifter might have have catlike eyes and a delicate build, while a beasthide shifter is likely a massive brute built like a bear. While a shifter's appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.</p>

      <h4>THE JOURNEY YET TO COME</h4>
      <p>Shifters have a strong presence in the Eldeen Reaches, and they often live among humans and can be found in rural areas across Khorvaire. While they form powerful bonds with friends and kin, shifters place great value on self-reliance and freedom. It's a shifter proverb to &#34;always be prepared for the journey yet to come,&#34; and most shifters strive to be ready for a change or opportunity.</p>
      <p class="indent">Shifters have a natural inclination toward classes with a primal connection. A shifter barbarian draws their rage from the beast within. A shifter ranger indulges their urge to wander and hunt. A shifter rouge harnesses their own predatory instincts. But shifters can pursue any path or faith.</p>

      <h4>SHIFTER NAMES</h4>
      <p>Shifters have no language of their own and often live in blended communities. As such, shifter names typically overlap with the names of other cultures in their region. Many shifters prefer to keep their personal names for their friends and use &#34;wandering names&#34; with strangers. These are usually tied to an obvious physical or personality trait.</p>
