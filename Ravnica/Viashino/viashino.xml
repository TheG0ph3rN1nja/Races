    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Many reptiles derive their body warmth and energy from the sun, but the humanoid viashino are fueled by an inner fire of zeal. Open with their emotions, viashino can be hot-tempered, but they are also quick to their hissing laughter. And they easily form close bonds of friendships. They are fierce warriors and passionate advocates for their guilds and causes.</p>

      <h4>SCALED SKIN AND TAIL BLADES</h4>
      <p>Viashino resemble humanoid lizards covered in green, scaled skin and spiky protrusions. Their heads jut forward from their slender necks and bear huge mouth full of sharp teeth. Long, whiplike tails extend from their spines, lashing behind them-faster and faster as they grow more agitated. Their tails are tipped with bony blades they can use as weapons.</p>

      <h4>FERVENT AND FIERY</h4>
      <p>Viashino are fiercely emotional and often violent, and their wizards and sorcerers favor fire spells that reflect their inner fire. They are most common among the Gruul Clans, especially the Slizt clan. Occasionally they put their zealous fire to use in the service of higher ideals, joining  the Boros Legion. Other Viashino instead pursue careers in the Izzet League, where they find a special role wielding Izzet-designed flame-spewing scorchbringers.</p>
      <p class="indent">Like fire itself, viashino are quick to leap from one situation to another, and they are frequently destructive in the process. They enjoy brawling and often cause more injury than intended, thanks to their teeth and bladed tails.</p>
      <p class="indent">They're also easily distracted, jumping from one idea to another in an instant. Likewise, they're easily bored, and if nothing captures their attention, they'll do something interesting.</p>

      <h4>VIASHINO NAMES</h4>
      <p>Viashino accept, collect, and discard names freely, choosing names that fit their current sense of self or whim. Sometimes they'll string two or more names together, because they like they sound or because all the names feel meaningful and relevant at the time. As a result, members of other races often have a hard time keeping track of a viashino's name.</p>
