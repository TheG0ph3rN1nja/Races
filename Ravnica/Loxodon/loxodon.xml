    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Humanoid elephants, loxodons are often oases of calm in the busy streets of Ravnica. They hum or chant in their sonorous tones and moves slowly or sit in perfect stillness. Provoked to action, loxodons are holy terrors-bellowing with rage,trumpeting and flapping their ears. Their still wisdom and their furious strength-as well as their fierce loyalty and unwavering conviction- are tremendous assets to their guilds.</p>

      <h4>LUMBERING GIANTS</h4>
      <p>Loxodons tower above most other humanoids, standing over seven feet tall. They have the heads-trunks, tusks, ears, and faces-of elephants, and hulking humanoid bodies covered by thick leathery skin. Their hands have four thick digits, and their feet are the flat, oval shaped feet of elephants.</p>
      <p class="indent">Like that of an elephant, a loxodon's trunk is a usefuls appendage that supplements the hands in addition to providing a keen sense of smell, the trunk can be used to lift and carry even heavy objects, and the two finger-like protrusions at the tip are capable of delicate manipulation. The trunk can be used to carry both food and liquid to the mouth and can even act as a snorkel.</p>

      <h4>GIFTED STONEWORKERS</h4>
      <p>Loxodons are tireless, patient artisans, with an unrivaled intuition about their craft. While they make nurturing spiritual leaders, their gifts at stonework is so natural that they are often at a loss when it comes to imparting their knowledge to others. Among the Selesnya, it primarily falls to them to build the guild's magnificent cathedral-like arboretum structures.</p>

      <h4>RELENTLESSLY LOYAL</h4>
      <p>Loxodons believe in the value of the community and life, and thus are most often found in the Selesnya Conclave. Some who stress the benefits of order have been known to join the Orzhov Syndicate or the Azorious Senate.</p>
      <p class="indent">Loxodons believe that the members of a group have a responsibility to look out for each other. Once they have joined a guild or bonded with other individuals in any capacity, they devote themselves to maintaining that bond. They coordinate their efforts and are often willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the group. They expect the same loyalty and commitment from the other members of their communities and can be severe in their disapointment when their trust is betrayed.</p>
      <p class="indent">The primary difference among loxodons who join different guilds is their senses of the size of the communities they belong to. For loxodons in the Selesnya Conclave, the community is the world and all living beings in it, all valuable, all meant to live in harmony, and all interdependent. For Azorious loxodons, community primarily means the society of sentient races, who need law and order in order to function together. For those in the Orzhov Syndicate, community means the syndicate, with its interests taking priority over those of any other group.</p>

      <h4>LOXODON NAMES</h4>
      <p>A loxodon's name includes overtones of sound, produced in a loxodon's resonant nasal chambers, that indicate status, family connection, and community role. Since most members of other races can't hear or distinguish these tones, let alone produce them, loxodons often translate them into titles, such as Hierarch, Reverend, Grandmother, Healer, or Saint.</p>
